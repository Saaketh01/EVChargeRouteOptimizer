## EV Charging Route Optimizer

Description: This project implements an optimized path-finding solution for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The system calculates the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a network of EV charging stations. The solution is designed to reduce travel time and energy consumption, benefiting users who need to find the most efficient route to their next charging station.

Key Features:
Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation: The project applies Dijkstra's algorithm in Python to calculate the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in the network, ensuring an optimized route.
Energy-Efficient Routing: The solution focuses on minimizing travel time and energy consumption by considering the shortest paths between EV charging stations.
Iterative Path Updates: The algorithm updates and recalculates the shortest paths dynamically, providing the most up-to-date route based on the current state of the network.

Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used to implement the Dijkstra's Algorithm and handle data processing for the path calculations.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: A graph-based algorithm used to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a network, crucial for optimizing routes for EV charging stations.
